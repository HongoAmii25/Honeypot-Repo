I successfully deployed the honeypot on an AWS EC2 instance.
During the initial deployment, I received a few connection attempts from bots. Most of them disconnected shortly after establishing connection, and no credentials or commands were captured beyond the initial handshake. 
To ensure everything was working as intended, I tested the honeypot on my local machine to make sure it was working, then deployed it to the cloud. Everything appeared to be functioning as intended on both ends.
Did not receive a lot of traffic on port 2222; plan on rerouting to port 22

Rerouting to port 22 did result in increased traffic; however, most connections disconnect shortly after. I haven't had any success capturing commands or attack methods. This may be because the honeypot I built appears unrealistic to attackers.
Regardless, I plan to implement a SIEM and possibly an IDS next.
